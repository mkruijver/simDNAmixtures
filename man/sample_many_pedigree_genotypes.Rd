\title{Sample (many) genotypes for pedigree members according to allele frequencies by allele dropping and possibly taking linkage into account by simulating recombination.}
\usage{
sample_many_pedigree_genotypes(
  pedigree,
  freqs,
  loci = names(freqs),
  linkage_map = NULL,
  number_of_replicates = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pedigree}{\link[pedtools:ped]{ped} object}

\item{freqs}{Allele frequencies (see \link{read_allele_freqs})}

\item{loci}{Character vector of locus names (defaults to \code{names} attribute of \code{freqs})}

\item{linkage_map}{A linkage map specifying the recombination fractions between loci. If NULL, loci are assumed to be independent.}

\item{number_of_replicates}{An integer specifying the number of replicate genotype samples to generate. Defaults to 1.}
